## 🌍 **Game Concept**

**Mirrorverse** features two characters in mirrored dimensions.  
Each player input moves one character normally and the other in the reverse direction.  
The goal is to strategically control both characters simultaneously, navigate through obstacles, swap colors via portals, and reach their individual goal zones **at the same time**.
